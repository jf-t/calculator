# Calculator app


This was cloned from https://github.com/DimitriMikadze/express-react-redux-starter initially. A lot of react and redux is boilerplate code, so I typically use a github boilerplate repo to set up the basic application, so I can focus more on the React/Redux itself rather than setting it up.


To run this locally: 
- Clone locally
- npm i
- npm run dev

There will be tests added to the calculator brain file later on! I worked a little over 4 hours on this and that was the expected limit for this coding challenge.

# Calculator app


This was cloned from https://github.com/DimitriMikadze/express-react-redux-starter initially. A lot of react and redux is boilerplate code, so I typically use a github boilerplate repo to set up the basic application, so I can focus more on the React/Redux itself rather than setting it up.


To run this calculator:

- clone this repo and cd into it
- ```npm i```
- ```npm start```

To run jasmine tests:
- ```npm test```

Note: The jasmine tests are only written to test the calculator logic itself. I only had enough time at the end of the day to write those tests because I felt they are the most meaningful tests to have. I didnt get around to any react/redux tests.. They would be really small anyway.

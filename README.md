# Calculator app


This was cloned from https://github.com/DimitriMikadze/express-react-redux-starter initially. A lot of react and redux is boilerplate code, so I typically use a github boilerplate repo to set up the basic application, so I can focus more on the React/Redux itself rather than setting it up.


I will add a README when i get nearer to done.
